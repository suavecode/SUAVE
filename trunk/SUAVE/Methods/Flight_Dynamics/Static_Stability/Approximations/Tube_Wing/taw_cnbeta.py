def taw_cnbeta(geometry,conditions,configuration):
    """ CnBeta = SUAVE.Methods.Flight_Dynamics.Static_Stability.Approximations.Tube_Wing.taw_cnbeta(configuration,conditions)
        This method computes the static directional stability derivative for a
        standard Tube-and-Wing aircraft configuration.        
        
        CAUTION: The correlations used in this method do not account for the
        destabilizing moments due to propellers. This can lead to higher-than-
        expected values of CnBeta, particularly for smaller prop-driven aircraft

                the fuselage data dictionary (described above), except no value

            CnBeta - a single float value: The static directional stability 
            derivative
                
        Assumptions:
            -Assumes a tube-and-wing configuration with a single centered 
            vertical tail
            -Uses vertical tail effective aspect ratio, currently calculated by
            hand, using methods from USAF Stability and Control DATCOM
            -The validity of correlations for KN is questionable for sqrt(h1/h2)
            greater than about 4 or h_max/w_max outside [0.3,2].
            -This method assumes a small angle of attack, so the vertical tail AC
            z-position does not affect the sideslip derivative.
        
        Correlations:
            -Correlations are taken from Roskam's Airplane Design, Part VI.
