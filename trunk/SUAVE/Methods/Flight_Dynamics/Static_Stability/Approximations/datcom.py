# NOTES/QUESTIONS
# - May need to bring in Roskam Figure 8.47 data (Airplane Design Part VI) for supersonic
#    - IS THIS ACTUALLY VALID FOR SUPERSONIC? ROSKAM FRAMES IT AS A SUBSONIC METHOD
# - For now, this uses an assumed 2D lift coefficient slope of 6.13rad^-1, from Roskam.
#   Should possibly later change it to take a Cl_alpha input based on VPM, etc.
# - Possibly add an effective aspect ratio variable to the wing object for winglet effects, etc.

def datcom(wing,mach):
    """ cL_alpha = SUAVE.Methods.Flight_Dynamics.Static_Stability.Approximations.datcom(wing,mach)
        This method uses the DATCOM formula to compute dCL/dalpha without 
        correlations for downwash of lifting surfaces further ahead on the 
        aircraft or upwash resulting from the position of the wing on the body.
        
        CAUTION: The method presented here is applicable for subsonic speeds.
        May be inaccurate for transonic or supersonic flight. A correction factor
        for supersonic flight is included, but may not be completely accurate.
        
        Inputs:
            wing - a data dictionary with the fields:
                effective_apsect_ratio - wing aspect ratio [dimensionless]. If 
                this variable is not inlcuded in the input, the method will look
                for a variable named 'aspect_ratio'.
                sweep_le - wing leading-edge sweep angle [radians]
                taper - wing taper ratio [dimensionless]
            mach - flight Mach number [dimensionless]. Should be a numpy array
                with one or more elements.
    
        Outputs:
            cL_alpha - The derivative of 3D lift coefficient with respect to AoA
                
        Assumptions:
            -Mach number should not be transonic
