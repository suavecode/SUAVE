    """This calls OpenVSP to compute the wetted areas of a previously written vehicle.
    
    Assumptions:
    Vehicle must be open in OpenVSP (via recently used vsp_write)
    All components have different tags. Repeated tags are added together under the
    assumption that this represents multiple engines or similar. Areas computed from
    repeated tags in this way may need to be divided by the number of entities later 
    before assignment. This is because some analyses may multiply an assigned area
    by number of engines, for example.

    Outputs:
