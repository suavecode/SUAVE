        Technically this is a converter, however this is stored in Distributors as it in analagous to the DC Power Supply for the HTS coils, and when used in combination with the HTS dynamo the power supplied to this component electrically is delivered as electric power to the HTS coil.
        Practically this component is a ESC, a DC electric motor, and an attached gearbox, for example a Maxxon GP32 Planetary Gearbox, Maxxon EC-max 30 Brushless Motor, and a Maxxon DEC 50/5 Speed Controller.
