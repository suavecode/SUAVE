def phugoid(g, velocity, CD, CL):
    """ This calculates the natural frequency and damping ratio for the approximate 
    phugoid characteristics       

    Assumptions:
        constant angle of attack
        theta changes very slowly
        Inertial forces are neglected
        Neglect Cz_q
        Theta = 0
        X-Z axis is plane of symmetry
        Constant mass of aircraft
        Origin of axis system at c.g. of aircraft
        Aircraft is a rigid body
        Earth is inertial reference frame
        Perturbations from equilibrium are small
        Flow is Quasisteady

    Inputs:
        g - gravitational constant                                   [meters/second**2]
        velocity - flight velocity at the condition being considered [meters/seconds]
        CD - coefficient of drag                                     [dimensionless]
        CL - coefficient of lift                                     [dimensionless]

    Outputs:
        output - a data dictionary with fields:
            phugoid_w_n - natural frequency of the phugoid mode      [radian/second]
