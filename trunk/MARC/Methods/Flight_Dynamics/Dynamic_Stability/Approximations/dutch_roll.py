def dutch_roll(velocity, Cn_Beta, S_gross_w, density, span, I_z, Cn_r):
    """ This calculates the natural frequency and damping ratio for the 
    approximate dutch roll characteristics       

    Assumptions:
        Major effect of rudder deflection is the generation of the Dutch roll mode.
        Dutch roll mode only consists of sideslip and yaw
        Beta = -Psi
        Phi and its derivatives are zero
        consider only delta_r input and Theta = 0
        Neglect Cy_r
        X-Z axis is plane of symmetry
        Constant mass of aircraft
        Origin of axis system at c.g. of aircraft
        Aircraft is a rigid body
        Earth is inertial reference frame
        Perturbations from equilibrium are small
        Flow is Quasisteady

    Inputs:
        velocity - flight velocity at the condition being considered          [meters/seconds]
        Cn_Beta - coefficient for change in yawing moment due to sideslip     [dimensionless]
        S_gross_w - area of the wing                                          [meters**2]
        density - flight density at condition being considered                [kg/meters**3]
        span - wing span of the aircraft                                      [meters]
        I_z - moment of interia about the body z axis                         [kg * meters**2]
        Cn_r - coefficient for change in yawing moment due to yawing velocity [dimensionless]

        dutch_w_n - natural frequency of the dutch roll mode                  [radian/second]
