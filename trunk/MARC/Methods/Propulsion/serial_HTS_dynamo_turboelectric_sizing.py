    create and evaluate a serial hybrid network that follows the power flow:
    Turboelectric Generators -> Motor Drivers -> Electric Propulsion Motors
    where the electric motors have cryogenically cooled HTS rotors that follow the power flow:
    Turboelectric Generators -> HTS Dynamo -> HTS Rotor Coils
    and
    Turboelectric Generators -> Cryocooler <- HTS Rotor Heat Load
    There is also the capability for the HTS components to be cryogenically cooled using liquid or gaseous cryogen, howver this is not sized other than applying a factor to the cryocooler required power.

    creates and evaluates a ducted_fan network based on an atmospheric sizing condition
    creates and evaluates a serial hybrid network that includes a HTS motor driven ducted fan, turboelectric generator, and the required supporting equipment including cryogenic cooling and HTS dynamo current supply.

    Assumptions:
        One powertrain model represents all engines in the model.
        There are no transmission losses between components
        the shaft torque and power required from the fan is the same as what would be required from the fan of a turbofan engine.
