    """ Calculate the weight of the vertical fin of an aircraft without the weight of 
    the rudder and then calculate the weight of the rudder 
    
    Assumptions:
        Vertical tail weight is the weight of the vertical fin without the rudder weight.
        Rudder occupies 25% of the S_v and weighs 60% more per unit area.     
        
    Source: 
        N/A 
        
    Inputs:
        S_v - area of the vertical tail (combined fin and rudder)                      [meters**2]
        vehicle.envelope.ultimate_load - ultimate load of the aircraft                 [dimensionless]
        wing.spans.projected - span of the vertical                                    [meters]
        vehicle.mass_properties.max_takeoff - maximum takeoff weight of the aircraft   [kilograms]
        wing.thickness_to_chord- thickness-to-chord ratio of the vertical tail         [dimensionless]
        wing.sweeps.quarter_chord - sweep angle of the vertical tail                   [radians]
        vehicle.reference_area - wing gross area                                       [meters**2]
        wing.t_tail - factor to determine if aircraft has a t-tail                     [dimensionless]
        rudder_fraction - fraction of the vertical tail that is the rudder             [dimensionless]
    
    Outputs:
        output - a dictionary with outputs:
            wt_tail_vertical - weight of the vertical fin portion of the vertical tail [kilograms]
            wt_rudder - weight of the rudder on the aircraft                           [kilograms]
