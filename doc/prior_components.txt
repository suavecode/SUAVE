This file describes capabilities or files that have previously existed within SUAVE and have since been removed.

All of these files below can be found in the initial public release of the code (0.2.0)

* /SUAVE/Methods/Structures/
	a place for structures methods

* /SUAVE/Methods/Solvers/
	various solvers that have not been used since the beginning of the code  including:
	line search
	newton solver
	pseudospectral methods that is already incorporated in SUAVE
	runge_kutta 45 
	Jacobians for missions including using AD
	Residuals

	Many of these are either handled by SciPy or integrated within SUAVE

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Chebyshev/cosine_space.py
	already integrated into other functions

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Chebyshev/chebyshev_interpolate.py
	already integrated into Utilities

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Chebyshev/chebyshev_basis_function.py
	already integrated into Utilities

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/switch
	an old class that is no longer used, can be found here: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/410692/

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Chebyshev/chebyshev_fit.py
	already integrated into Utilities

* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Chebyshev/PlotDock.py
	a function which allowed for interactive plotting
	
* /SUAVE/Methods/Utilities/Utilities.py
        A variety of mathematical utilities that were not in used or tested:
	runge_kutta_45
	psuedospectral
	chebyshev_data
	chebyshev_fit
	chebyshev_interpolate
	chebyshev_basis_function
	residuals
	residuals0
	residuals_unpowered
	residuals_uncontrolled
	jacobian_complex
	jacobian_AD
	create_guess
	unpack
	create_state_data
	assign_values

* /SUAVE/Weights/Correlations/Tube_Wing_Torenbeek
	These correlations were old and it was decided not to update them to the current code standards

* /SUAVE/Methods/Performance/weight_maneuver.py
	could be useful in the future for estimating extra fuel burn

* /SUAVE/Methods/Performance/climb_gradient.py
	used AA 241 notes from section 11.3, however it was too old to be updated directly

* /SUAVE/Methods/Performance/cruise_range.py
	used AA 241 notes from section 11.4 and the breguet range equation, however it was too old to be updated directly

* /SUAVE/Methods/Performance/weight_climb_added.py
	used AA 241 notes from section 11.3, however it was too old to be updated directly
